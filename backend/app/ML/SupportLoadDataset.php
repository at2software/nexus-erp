/**
 * Feature extraction for the support-load forecast — the single source of
 * truth shared between training (TrainSupportLoadModel) and inference
 * (SupportLoadModel::predict()).
 *
 * A training "row" is a (company, cutoff date) SNAPSHOT, exactly like
 * CustomerRevenueDataset — see CustomerSnapshots for the general leakage
 * boundary. What's new here is that BOTH the features and the label are
 * primarily driven by "support foci" rather than invoices:
 *
 * Support-hours definition (reused verbatim from the rest of the app, NOT
 * reinvented): foci attached directly to the company — `parent_type =
 * Company::class`, i.e. `$company->foci()` / `CustomerSnapshots::fociFor()` —
 * as opposed to foci logged against a project. This is the same predicate
 * `CompanyBuilder::whereHasUnbilledFoci()`, `WidgetController::
 * GET_CASHFLOW_CUSTOMER_SUPPORT` and `addFociBadges()` all use to identify
 * "support" work. Unlike `foci_unbilled` (used for the CASHFLOW_CUSTOMER_SUPPORT
 * forecast of money still to be invoiced), this dataset sums ALL support-focus
 * duration regardless of billed/unpaid status — the forecast target is hours
 * actually worked, not just what's still awaiting invoicing.
 *
 * The cutoff grid is quarterly over the company's OWN support-focus history
 * (CustomerSnapshots::fociCandidateCutoffs, keyed on `started_at`, not an
 * invoice's `created_at` — Focus rows don't have a comparable column), not
 * its invoice history — a customer can have a long invoice history with only
 * a recent burst of support activity, and the snapshot grid should track
 * where the LABEL signal actually lives.
