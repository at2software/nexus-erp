/**
 * Feature extraction for Model A — customer 12-month revenue regression — the
 * single source of truth shared between training (TrainCustomerRevenueModel)
 * and inference (CustomerRevenueModel::predict()).
 *
 * A training "row" is a (company, cutoff date) SNAPSHOT, not one row per
 * company: every FEATURES value is computed strictly from invoices with
 * `created_at <= cutoff` (see CustomerSnapshots), and the LABEL is the sum of
 * `net` for invoices in `(cutoff, cutoff + 12 months]`. Multiple snapshots per
 * company are correlated (they share history) — CustomerRevenueModel::evaluate()
 * groups CV folds by `company_id` to avoid leaking a company across folds.
