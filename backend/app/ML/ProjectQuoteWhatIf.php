 * which changes move the prediction meaningfully.
 *
 * `company_acceptance_rate` / `company_prior_decided_count` / `days_pending`
 * are deliberately excluded: they describe the customer's track record or
 * elapsed time, not something a PM writing THIS quote can change.

 * from a small, fixed per-feature template set.
