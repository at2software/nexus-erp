/**
 * Feature extraction for Model B — re-purchase interval prediction — the
 * single source of truth shared between training (TrainCustomerIntervalModel)
 * and inference (CustomerIntervalModel::predict()).
 *
 * A training "row" is a (company, cutoff date) SNAPSHOT: features come from
 * "purchase events" with `created_at <= cutoff` (see CustomerSnapshots for the
 * general leakage boundary), and the LABEL is the gap in days between the
 * cutoff's most recent purchase and the NEXT purchase event after it.
 *
 * "Purchase event" deliberately EXCLUDES invoices whose items are entirely
 * InvoiceItemType::Repeating (deterministic recurring subscriptions with a
 * known `next_recurrence_at` — the cadence is already known, so it's not an
 * interesting ML target and would just inject a trivially-predictable rhythm
 * into what should be a "when will they buy something new" signal). An invoice
 * counts as a purchase event if it has AT LEAST ONE non-Repeating item.
 * Model A (revenue) still counts repeating-item revenue — this exclusion is
 * specific to Model B's interval semantics.
